# Linux Systems Automation and Configuration Repository

This repository was created to simplify and automate the configuration of Linux systems, with a particular focus on **Ubuntu**-based distributions for development environments and servers.

The goal is to provide optimized scripts for automating critical tasks, reducing the time required for manual configuration. Features include:

- **Automated Proxy Configuration**:  
  Sets global proxy for environment variables, APT, and interactive shells.

- **Automated Installation of Essential Software**:
  - Node.js and npm  
  - Visual Studio Code (VSCode)  
  - MongoDB and related tools  
  - Other packages required for web development  

- **User Management**:
  - Creation and configuration of users  
  - Secure removal of users and their respective files  

- **Full System Installation and Configuration**:
  - Minimal Ubuntu installation from an official image  
  - Automatic partition table creation and disk formatting  
  - GRUB installation and boot system configuration  

### ⚠️ **Note**  
All commands and scripts must be executed with **superuser** privileges. We recommend running `sudo su` before starting any procedure to avoid permission errors.
